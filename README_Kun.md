Step 1: In LoadImage.py, we read resize every image in the id_train.csv to 64*64 pixel. then we generate 64*64*4 files (4 categories, 64*64 for every categories). Every file stores all the normalized gray scale value for one specific pixel for every image.

Step 2: In ComputationModel.py, we generate one median matrix for every category with 64*64 files in this category. This median matrx represents a standard pixel structure of a category so that we can compare an input image to this standard structure to decide with category the new input belongs to. We generatge also a weight matrix (same dimension as median matrix 64*64), every value in this matrix represents the weight of one pixel. This weight is defined according to the level of coherence of all values in this pixel. If the stardant deviation is too large, this means this the value of this pixel for every image is every different, so it is not important to the final decision. in reverse, we put a more important weight value to this pixel.

Step 3: In Prediction.py, we compare the new input to 3 standard matrix for North_South, East_West and Flat. We decide which category this new input belongs to by comparing every pixel to the standard pixel the find out the category which bring in less difference. And if the difference(error) is bigger than 0.23, we decide it belongs to Other category.

With this model, we can a precision of 50% of prediction.  # Data_science_game_2016Step 1: In LoadImage.py, we read resize every image in the id_train.csv to 64*64 pixel. then we generate 64*64*4 files (4 categories, 64*64 for every categories).
